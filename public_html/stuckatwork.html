        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There is a small market for VR games in general although growing very rapidly, most of the
            games are either
            intense causing some discomfort or they are relaxing experiences. There is a lack of experiences that
            challenge the mind by being in an intense situation(Solving problems) without causing such discomfort or
            some sort of motion sickness.
            With the release of the Oculus Quest 2 a lot of other headsets have been left to shame. Where a lot of new
            releases are becoming exclusive for the Device. This has left PC VR unable to play a lot of new releases
            that are coming out for the Quest 2. See my <a
                href="components/Problem Analysis VR.pdf"
                target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Problem Analysis</a> in more detail.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I propose the following solution to create an immersive experience that challenges the
            mind with puzzles
            accessible in VR. It will take the User through a Escape room with various puzzles that will make
            the User think outside the box to move the escape room to move to the next puzzle.
            Similar to such Escape rooms that can be participated at conventions of horror studios or that seen in
            standalone escape rooms, the user will have puzzles to solve with increasing difficulty and increasing
            number in order to reach the next.
            An escape room is a collection of puzzles that are hidden from the user that lead to an end goal of opening
            a door or leaving the room.

        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This project was approached in the Unity game Engine. I used C# with Visual studio code
            and preused assets from the unity asset store. I managed the code through github and propose ideas for
            organization through milanote.

        </p>
        <h3>Assets</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I worked strictly on the design and the programming of this project. Any of the extra
            assets I used can be viewed here. Except the paintings are my work from my digitial illustration
            concentration.
